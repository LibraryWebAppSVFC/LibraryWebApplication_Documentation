# HERONS LIBRARY: University of Makati Managing Library App Transaction

## INTRODUCTION

In today's digital age, fostering a love for reading and learning from an early age is more crucial than ever. 
Recognizing the need for a platform that caters to the unique needs of young learners, their parents, and educators, 
we are excited to introduce our project: the Library Web App. The Library Web App is designed to be a comprehensive, 
user-friendly online platform that transforms the way educational resources are accessed and managed. Tailored 
specifically for young children, this application aims to provide a seamless and engaging experience for its young 
users while offering robust tools for parents and teachers. The website features an intuitive layout and an appealing 
color scheme, with carefully chosen fonts to ensure ease of navigation and to create an inviting atmosphere for its 
diverse audience. Our goal with the Library Web App is to create a digital environment where learning is both enjoyable 
and accessible. By prioritizing simplicity and visual appeal, we aim to support young readers in their educational 
journey, empower parents to actively participate in their children's learning, and assist educators in managing and 
delivering valuable resources effectively. Through this project, we aspire to build a bridge between education and 
technology, making it easier for families and schools to engage with and benefit from the wealth of knowledge available 
in today’s digital world.


## Project Features and Characteristics
The proposed project Umak Library Mobile App consists of the following features:
1. Catalog Module - recording and monitoring of resources - librarian
2. User management module - logs - user
3. Circulation management module - generate qr and scan qr by the students for borrowing of
resources using Qr code - librarian and student
4. OPAC - searching - student
5. Reports - number of borrowers librarian
   a. Daily, weekly, monthly and semestral reports

## Project Scope

UMak Library Management System is proposed to provide a function that helps the librarian and the
student be productive and efficient with their tasks inside the University's Library. These cover the data
of the student, library materials and resources, and records of activities inside the library. In order to
support and provide the library with accurate data, efficient organizing and tracking of lists of records,
and track the activities within the library. The system may be provided to the Head librarian, library
staff, and to the College students of Umak.

However, the system only allows the student users to access the list of available resources and
materials that they can borrow insider the library, they cannot bring home the books outside the library
because it does not allow the student to do so. Currently the system does not provide e-books that can
be downloaded since it will affect the library data privacy. Only students can use or borrow the materials
inside the library.
