# Project General Information

Group Name: Group 1
Project Title: Library Web Application

## A. Problem Statement:
The issue is that there isn't a user-friendly online tool made especially for kindergarten settings that can be used to manage and access library resources. It is more difficult for parents, teachers, and young children to locate, check out, and return books that are appropriate for early learning requirements when they are absent. This gap might be filled by creating a kindergarten-specific library web app with an easy-to-use design, capabilities for managing books that are age-appropriate, and resources for teaching young readers and their teachers.

## B. Project Description:
The "Kindergarten Library Web App" is designed to provide a simple, user-friendly online platform for young children, their parents, and teachers to access and manage a library of educational resources. The website will feature a straightforward layout to ensure ease of use for its young users, with a color scheme and font choices carefully selected to appeal to children, parents, and educators alike. This web app will host a diverse collection of books, including poems, tales, and learning materials aimed at enhancing early reading and writing skills. By offering a streamlined and engaging interface, the Library Web App will facilitate an enjoyable and effective learning experience, helping to foster a love for reading and support educational development from an early age.
