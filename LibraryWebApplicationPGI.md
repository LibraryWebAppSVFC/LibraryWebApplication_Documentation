# Project General Information

Group Name: Group 1
Project Title: Library Web Application

## A. Problem Statement:
Traditional library systems often involve cumbersome processes for borrowing and returning books, leading to delays and dissatisfaction among users. Additionally, physical libraries have capacity constraints and cannot accommodate all readers' needs for multiple copies of popular books. The development of an online library web application would streamline the process of borrowing and returning e-books, offering users an easy and convenient platform to access a vast selection of digital books, manage their reading lists, and interact with other readers through reviews and ratings.

## B. Project Description:
This project involves the development of a web-based library platform designed to provide users with the convenience of browsing and reading e-books online from their homes. The platform addresses the need for better access to a wide range of e-books, eliminating the limitations of physical libraries, which often have restricted book availability or require users to borrow physical copies. The web application will feature an extensive collection of e-books across various genres, languages, and reading levels, ensuring that users can easily find books that match their interests. The platform will be designed with a user-friendly interface that allows readers to explore books by genre, author, or title, and access a digital library with just a few clicks.

## C. Project Objectives:
